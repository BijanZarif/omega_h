Compiling:
  Copy one of the *config.mk files and call
  it config.mk, or write your own.
  Then you can run `make`.
  By default, this will just compile the objects.
  To link the program "foo.exe", run
    make foo.exe
  Where "foo.c" has the main() function.

Included programs:
  test_warp.exe: Runs a 2D mesh adaptation test
    including mesh motion with a size field based
    on the hessian of a dye field.
  test_warp_3d.exe: Runs a 3D mesh adaptation test
    similar to test_warp.exe except the size field
    is constant.
  vtk_surfer.exe: A VTK file post-processing tool,
    run with no arguments for more information.
