mesh generation from CAD model:

1) for every CAD entity, generate
at least one sample point on it (or in it).

2) start with a "box" mesh around the
CAD bounding box,
refine the mesh until there is at most one
sample point per element.

3) use element splits to insert the sample
points with their classification.

(set the "size field" to be the identity
size field at this point)

4) classify all remaining points based
on which CAD region they are in
(including "empty space" region).

(also classify the actual boundary
of the box mesh onto some fake boundary,
just to keep it from collapsing inward)

5) for every edge whose vertices have
different CAD region classification,
split the edge and classify the new
vertex on the best CAD face.

6) repeat step (5) for CAD faces onto CAD edges

7) repeat step (6) for CAD edges onto CAD vertices

sprinkle steps 5-7 with shape correction /
size field based adaptivity
